EXT. HILLSIDE - SUNSET
A small robot gazes at the horizon. The wind hums softly. 
It finds a tiny sprout and shields it from dust. Hope rises.

INT. ABANDONED GARAGE - NIGHT
Storm rumbles. The robot struggles to fix a broken radio. Sparks fly. Tension builds.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN
The radio crackles alive with a warm melody. The sprout glistens with dew. 
The robot smiles. Resolution and triumph.
The hero begins with hope, dreaming of adventure.  
But soon, tension rises as challenges appear.  
Resolution comes when friends unite and triumph together.
