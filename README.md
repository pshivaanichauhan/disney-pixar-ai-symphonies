# 🎶 Disney–Pixar AI Symphonies 🎶

AI symphonies from Disney & Pixar storybeats — transforming narrative arcs into cinematic themes, rhythm banks, emotion heatmaps, and story arc timelines, orchestrated through Carnegie Hall’s Five Core Pillars.

## 🎭 Dual Perspective README

This README contains **two complementary sections**:  
- **Advanced (technical/academic)** → for researchers, developers, and symbolic AI experts.  
- **Creative (cinematic/accessible)** → for artists, storytellers, and wider audiences.  

You may keep both, or trim to the style that fits your repository best.

## 🧠 Advanced Section

This project translates **Disney & Pixar storybeats** into **AI–generated musical themes**, demonstrating **graduate-level AI methods** in symbolic music analysis.  

It reflects **Carnegie Hall’s Five Core Pillars**:

1. 🎨 **Expressive Nuance (CV)** → emotion heatmaps from frames  
2. ♟️ **Dynamic Collaboration (Game Theory)** → AI + human motif feedback  
3. 🎼 **Stylistic Authenticity (ML)** → Pixar style + Beethoven depth  
4. 🤖 **Precision & Scalability (RPA)** → automated beat-to-motif pipeline  
5. 📐 **Mathematical Depth (Algorithms & OOP)** → counterpoint, syncopation, metric modulation  

### 🔬 Advanced Components

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP Segmentation)**  
   - Finds optimal segmentation of motifs across arcs (hope → tension → resolution).  
   - 📦 Output: segmentation timeline overlaid on motifs.  

2. **Deep Learning (LSTM / Transformers)**  
   - Predicts motif evolution (variation, repetition, resolution).  
   - 📦 Output: transformed motifs in MIDI.  

3. **Multi-Layer Emotion Classifier**  
   - NN classifier (hope/tension/resolution) on symbolic datasets.  
   - 📦 Output: classifier probabilities feeding into motif heatmaps.  

4. **Stylistic Authenticity (ML Blend)**  
   - Trains on Pixar scores + Beethoven repertoire.  
   - 📦 Output: authenticity scorecard for every motif.  

5. **Mathematical Depth (Algorithms/OOP)**  
   - Recursive counterpoint, syncopation, metric modulation.  
   - 📦 Output: “Pixar Rhythm Bank” of algorithmic variations.

## 🎨 Creative Section

Imagine every Disney & Pixar story arc as a **symphony**:  

- **🎬 Themes** = cinematic hooks  
- **🥁 Rhythm Banks** = heartbeat of the story  
- **🎨 Heatmaps & Timelines** = emotion & pacing  
- **🎻 Orchestration** = guided by Carnegie Hall’s Five Pillars  
## 🎬 Disney/Pixar Animation & Rhythm Flow  

Disney & Pixar storytelling aligns **visual animation beats** with **musical rhythm arcs**.  
This creates what we call a *Pixar Rhythm*, captured by 4 components:  

1. **Storybeat Timing ⏱️** – narrative arcs broken into Pixar’s 7 beats (e.g., *Once upon a time… Until finally…*).  
2. **Animation Pacing 🎞️** – frame speed, scene changes, and motion intensity shaping emotional rhythm.  
3. **Rhythm Banks 🥁** – musical pulses that mirror pacing (tension/release, heartbeat vs. breath).  
4. **Emotion Heatmaps 🎨** – AI-mapped intensity curves across story arcs, orchestrated through motifs.  

✨ Together, these turn animation into **living AI symphonies** — where story, motion, and music lock into one rhythm.

This project bridges **Hollywood storytelling** with **Carnegie Hall rigor**, transforming narrative beats into **living AI symphonies**.  

It’s both a **technical framework** and a **creative experiment**, showing how AI can listen to story arcs and respond with music that feels cinematic, authentic, and emotionally intelligent.
